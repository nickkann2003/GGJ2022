This is a short game created by Nicholas Kannenberg for Global Game Jam 2022. It was created entirely from scratch in Monogame.

Floatsom was designed with the theme of duality in mind. In the first phase, the player is locked in a box with limited movement. 
For each second they spend in the box, they get additional time in the second phase, which releases them into a dream-like world with full movement and a responsive background.

The goal of the game was to convey the duality between dreams and reality, and how there must be a balance between the two.
